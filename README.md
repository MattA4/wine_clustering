# wine_clustering
Project using PCA and K Means clustering to group wines by chemical features

Project using python, various libraries, and data from kaggle.com/maitree/wine-quality-selection to build clustering models to group wines based on chemical features such as sulphates, alcohol and residual sugar. The aim of this project was so that hypothetically a wine shop would be able to use the model to recommend other wines to customers based on what clustered closely with a wine they like.
